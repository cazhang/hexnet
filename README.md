You can use this code to generate Omni-Synthia dataset used in our paper for semantic segmentation experiments:

[ICCV 2019]Orientation-aware semantic segmentation on icosahedron spheres, http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Zhang_Orientation-Aware_Semantic_Segmentation_on_Icosahedron_Spheres_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf

Follow two simple steps:
### 1. download SYNTHIA dataset
### 2. run pers2equirect_synthia_iccv.m to generate equirectangular version data of selected sequences (check the paper for details)
